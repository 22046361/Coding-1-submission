# Coding-1-Final Project submission
Repository for the submission of Term 1 


Hello! 

// Thanks for all the knowledge, tips, suggestions this term! Challenging for a complete beginner but very interesting! 

The final project is a Love Story - the story between 2 foxes (named ARI & IAR), that live in 2 different planets - little Prince inspiration, no innovation in that - but there was a sustainable message to connection with non-humans. In a way anthropomorphising the foxes. 

Ideally this could have been the starting point of an interactive VR game... finding ways to connect the foxes (possible even exploring their relationship after the 'happily ever after' and finding ways to separate them.... give them some space.... e.g., maybe Ari wanted some space to chill-out.... Maybe each planet could have each on identity (not simply an ID – joke).

Not there yet with the full development of the set-up, due to time (and knowledge) constrains, but still a starting point.  The scene is showing the starting point –(super-non-gravity) Foxes that can see each other, with a planet system around…. 

I choose to use A-Frame and the accelerate-editor as an opportunity to practice and explore the opportunities of this framework, as VR is something that I want to work in the future. But also, for a complete beginner like me, this option possibly have allowed me to do something a bit more creative (after spending days on exploring other options) than what I produced for the homework – thanks for offering this option! Really enjoyed it! 

For this scene, I tried to combine knowledge on animation (rotation & movement), texturing, and including audio as part of the project, as demonstration of the different opportunities showed during the term. 


The music audio is the Across the Stars: Love Theme, downloaded from https://many-ringtones.com. 
Star wars - across the stars (no date) Ringtones.com. Available at: https://many-ringtones.com/23475-star-wars-across-the-stars.html (Accessed: November 27, 2022). 

Should I have more time, I would have liked to possibly work more on the interactivity (e.g. different planets, making different sounds, possibly using Maximillian), or creating a path of interactive discovery (finding hints to connect the foxes) etc. 

Thanks again for all and the positive energy this term!
